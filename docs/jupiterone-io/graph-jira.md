# Integration with JupiterOne

## Jira + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Jira projects, users, and issues in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map Jira users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor Jira issues configured as vulnerabilities or findings within the
  alerts app.
- Monitor changes to Jira users, projects, and issues using JupiterOne alerts.
- Create Jira issues from JupiterOne alerts and monitor progress against those
  issues in JupiterOne.
- Create Jira issues from JupiterOne compliance controls that need attention.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches Jira projects, users, and issues to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires the hostname for your Jira organization. JupiterOne also requires the 
email and password for a user that has the correct permissions enabled. Use an API key instead
of a user's password when MFA is enabled.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Support

If you need help with this integration, please contact
[JupiterOne Support](https://support.jupiterone.io).

## Integration Walkthrough

Customers authorize access to JupiterOne by creating a Jira user and providing
the username and password (or [API token][2] when passwords require MFA) to
JupiterOne for HTTP Basic Auth as described in the [Jira Security for Other
Integrations][1] documentation.

### In Jira

#### Configure a User for API Access

It is recommended that you create an Atlassian user for exclusive use by
JupiterOne (a "service account" user). This user will be limited to the
permissions required for the integration to function.

!!! note
    
    The Jira Free plan treats all users as an admin. You may simply use
    your user to create an API token.

1. Create a new email address in your organization's domain, such as
   `jupiterone+jira@yourdomain.com`.
1. Log into [Atlassian Admin][aadmin] and navigate to *Manage Users* for the
   Organization owning the target Jira account.
1. Click *Invite users* to invite the service account.
   - Role: Basic
   - Product access: Jira Software
   - Group membership: `jira-software-users`

##### Permissions

- Authorize the user to read groups and users by granting the ["Browse Users"
  global permission][5]. This allows JupiterOne to provide visibility into Jira
  access.
- Authorize browse access to projects configured in JupiterOne. Use [group,
  project, role, and issue security features of Jira][3] to manage the user's
  access. Note that restricting to read-only access will require explicit
  removal of write permissions. Please see the Jira article on [How to Create a
  Read Only User][4].
- Authorize "Create Issues" permissions in projects that serve as JupiterOne
   Alert Rule action targets.

##### Create an API Token

1. Log in to Jira as the JupiterOne user and follow the Jira guide to [create an API token][2].

### In JupiterOne

1. From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Jira** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:
- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Jira
   account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
   `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
   the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
   needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
- Enter the **Hostname** of your organization.
- Enter the **User Email** used to authenticate with Jira.
- Enter the **User Password** associated with the user email, or the **API Key**
if the password requires MFA.
- Enter the **Project Keys** that the integration will retrieve data from.
4. Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.

## How to Uninstall

1. From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Jira** integration tile and click it.
3. Identify and click the **integration to delete**.
4. Click the **trash can** icon.
5. Click the **Remove** button to delete the integration.

## Data Model

### Entities

The following entity resources are ingested when the integration runs:

| Jira Resource | \_type of the Entity | \_class of the Entity |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Account       | `jira_account`       | `Account`             |
| Project       | `jira_project`       | `Project`             |
| User          | `jira_user`          | `User`                |
| Issue \*      | `jira_issue`         | `Record`              |

(\*) The integration ingests issues up to a year prior to the date of execution.
Issues ingested are kept as records, such that issues older than a year that
were previously ingested will remain in the graph when the integration runs
again. Issues are deleted only when the integration instance is deleted, along
with other entities associated with the integration instance.

### Relationships

The following relationships are created/mapped:

| From           | Type         | To             |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `jira_account` | **HAS**      | `jira_project` |
| `jira_project` | **HAS**      | `jira_issue`   |
| `jira_user`    | **CREATED**  | `jira_issue`   |
| `jira_user`    | **REPORTED** | `jira_issue`   |

## Pro Tips

In Jira, if you create custom issue types and use one of the following, the
integration will parse and translate them to the corresponding entity class:

- `Change` (this also maps when the issue key starts with `PRODCM`)
- `Finding`
- `Incident`
- `Risk`
- `Vulnerability`
